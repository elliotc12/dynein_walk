  notes={This paper uses quick-freeze and cryo-em tomography to find the low-resolution structure of axonemal dyneins while freely moving. It ffinds that the head/stalk rotate during the pre-powerstroke and are forward displaced, and that the motion is similar to a jackknife. They suggest that rotation of the head is really important for the powerstroke (and prestroke). They say that there are two prestroke states, one MTBD unbound, and the other MTBD-bound, where the latter is rotated 20 degrees anticlockwise. This suggests that the head is somewhat 'undoing' its prestroke angle change. They also say the linker remains stationary through the whole cycle. They talk about the two dynein heads moving at different rates, supporting an 'inchworm' mechanism. The fact that this is a low time-resolution technique seems like a good reason for why they didn't discover stalk deflection.}

  notes={A one-dimensional model which tracks the position of cargo, tail, heads and MTBDs. It doesn't take into account y, only x. Uses springy rods, not springy angles. This model is winch-like in that it doesn't allow its stalk or tail angles to change, which is a weakness. It is also a pro-winch model. They also have predetermined binding sites, which is an advantage of our model. The model domains are effectively projeted into 1D, which is unphysical. They use a weird dashpot-spring force mechanism to force steps, which seems very unphysical. We allow stepping to happen naturally, whereas they force the model to step a certain length. Also makes assumptions about stepping order in a wird way, doesn't do tension-gating. Doesn't have any bothbound dynamics, which make up most of the dynamics of dynein, according to our theory. Their unbinding rates don't take into account conformational information or tension-gating, whereas ours do. No brownian forces. No conformational changes, very artificial foot movement. Main issues: lack of any biophysical step mechanism, no Brownian dynamics, 1D, assumes winch model.}

  notes={Builds on the Imamula model, which is the basic picture that we think of: ATP binding, MT unbinding, prestroke, Pi rejection, MT binding, powerstroke, ADP rejection. They come up with a more complicated model which includes both heads. They report the rate constants for almost all the transition rates in the Imamula model. Their model also combines different things, like ATP binding with MT unbinding. They describe all possible cycles a 2-headed dynein could take. Both taking the prestroke and unbinding ADP happen pretty slowly, with ADP unbinding being the slowest step. Thus it seems like waiting-to-powerstroke and waiting-to-unbind are prominent steps in the mechanochemical cycle; however, if dissociation takes longer than powerstroke, then it would make sense to say the waiting-to-unbind state is more prominent than waiting-to-powerstroke. Despite erroneously combining these two states, textually they say that ADP-bound is the most occupied state, and that when each head drops ADP is goes through its entire cycle before the other head unbinds ADP, which agrees exactly with our model. They then talk about coordination schemes between the two motor heads and describe how these are necessary to achieve physical velocities. They say "ADP release is believed to be the rate-limiting step."}

In light of their finding that the linker powerstroke occurs before the MTBD low->high transition, they present a model (the winch model?) where the powerstroke occurs when the MTBD is in a low-affinity mode (MT unbound?) and the head somehow rotates/translates, which somehow causes the head to diffuse forward and rebind MT, going into the high-affinity state. This seems winch-like. It seems that the pre->post transition takes ~5-10us, while the post->pre takes ~2us.},

@Comment ----Questions for David----
@Comment Yildiz 2012 fig 1B does head-labeling of dynein, but we're comparing it to our MTBD-labelled data. Is this fair or should we do head-labelling? imaibugress say that due to flexibility of
@Comment       the stalk, the head position is not a reliable indicator of foot position. Should we move to head-position averaging to compare with Yildiz's data?
@Comment Do we need to justify our tension gating? Should we run the model with c=0 to show that the behavior is worse? Maybe our model could work fine with c=0.
@Comment We have the the initial/final displacement plot, which seems to show that the displacements are dependent. However, the figure isn't quantitative. Should we think about getting the
@Comment      correlation coefficient / mutual information of variables like OB/BB time, step length, etc between i and i+1 steps to be more quantitative and prove our point?
